# Chicago Style

__Conform your content to the Chicago Manual of Style__

Words are the foundation of the world. We pour our words into the fields of CMS
(content management systems). Yet, these CMS don't help authors to follow a
style manual. This package is meant to bridge the gap. There are several style
manuals. However, this project helps you to use the Chicago Manual of Style.
